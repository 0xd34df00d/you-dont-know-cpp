- How is `return {};` different from `return T {};`? What types of `T` would behave differently?
  
  Hint: how does it depend on C++ standard version?
  Hint2: consider `std::mutex`

- Assume an instance of a `struct` is `memset`ed to zeros. What would be the value of the padding?
  Further assume a field of that structure is updated. What would be the value of the padding?
